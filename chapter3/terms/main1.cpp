/*
1. Abstraction: Abstraction is a concept where programmers essentially don't need to look at the underlying architecture or code for anything they use, but just know that it works as intended and know how to use it.
2. Function: A function is a block of code which has a name, returns a data type and can optinally take arguments. Functions are useful to seperate out logic of our program. It serves two major needs- first it reduces the programmer's need to repeat themselves and second it'll make sure that you're only modifying your function if you want any changes in it and hence not break the entire system.
3. rvalue: Anything which is on the right side of the assignment operator is called the rvalue. For example, int a = 4; Here, 4 is the rvalue.
4. Decleration: Decleration is basically making the compiler know that a variable/function by that data type exists. For example- int v {4}; is declaring that there's an object named v which holds the value 4 and it's an integer.
5. iteration: Looping over a variable or anything else is said that we are iterating over that variable.
6. Repetition: Repetition is very much required in programming where we want to repeat over something over and over again and for this there are while, for and do while loops in c++.
7. Conditional-statement: Conditional statements are used to make the computer do different things based on a condition. The syntax is basically if(condition) 
8. Input: Input is any kind of data we give to our program- it can be text, audio, video and a lot of things.
9. sort(): sort is a std library function used to sort vectors. It's general syntax is sort(vector.begin(), vector,end())
10. push_back(): Pushback is a method to add an element to end of a vector.
